# git init
The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.
If you wanted to create a new directory and initialze a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands usch as
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./Commit.md),
[push](./Push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current diectory and will encapulate all content, including other directories.
